# Welcome to my Huckleberry project

HuckleLab is my personal playground for building small features, exploring ideas, and having fun along the way ‚ú®

A space for testing and experimentation ‚Äî no big frameworks, no deadlines, just curiosity.

This is a simple React application built with TypeScript, Tailwind, CSS, Jest, and Prettier. Navigate to the Star Wars Encyclopedia to see a list of characters.

## ‚ú® Explore the Pages

### Rick and Morty üöß

A character gallery that displays characters from the Rick and Morty API using GraphQL queries.

**Features:**

- Fetches character data from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API
- Displays character information including name, status, species, gender, and image
- Responsive grid layout

**Technical Notes:**

_GraphQL Query Management:_ For this project, I've decided to keep things simple and use manual query definitions rather than setting up GraphQL Code Generator. Since I'm working with just a handful of queries, adding code generation would be overkill and bring unnecessary complexity.

### Star Wars Encyclopedia üöß

A static encyclopedia displaying famous characters from the Star Wars universe.

**Features:**

- Static character data (no API calls)
- Character information including name, role, and description
- Card-based layout with hover effects

### Botanix üöß

Explore a wide variety of plants, add, edit, or remove entries, and easily search or filter your plant collection.

**Features:**

- Browse a collection of plants
- Add, edit, and remove plant entries
- Search and filter functionality
- Plant care instructions and details

**Technical Notes:**

- **Database:** In development, Botanix uses `json-server` to serve data from `src/pages/Botanix/db.json`, which contains a structured array of plant objects.
- **Production:** On GitHub Pages, Botanix fetches data from a static file located at `/public/db_botanix.json`. This file is read-only, so any mutations (add/edit/delete) are not supported in production.
- **Unified API Endpoint:** The frontend always fetches from `/api/plants`. In development, Vite's proxy redirects this to `json-server`, and in production, it fetches the static JSON file.
- **Limitations:** Since the production version relies on a static JSON file, the content cannot be mutated. Operations are read-only. Any changes to plant data require updating the JSON file and redeploying.

## üõ†Ô∏è Peek Behind the Scenes

A quick look at the tech stack, tools, and libraries used to build HuckleLab:

- Vite: Super fast build tool that makes local development smooth and instant.
- TypeScript: Adds type safety and better structure to the code, keeping things neat.
- Radix UI: A set of accessible, unstyled components that make it easy to build flexible UIs.
- React: The heart of the project, building the interactive UI with reusable components.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling fast and responsively.
- Apollo Client (GraphQL): Handles data fetching and state management when working with GraphQL APIs.
- JSON server: Provides a simple mock REST API for local development, allowing the frontend to fetch data without setting up a full backend.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project can be deployed either to **GitHub Pages** or **Vercel**. Both deployments are public and accessible without requiring authentication.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Due to GitHub Pages serving the site under a subpath (`/huckleberry/`), some image URLs may break when navigating between pages. Images work correctly in production on Vercel or other static hosts that serve from the root (`/`) without a subpath.

**Live URL:** [https://miriam-mr90.github.io/huckleberry/](https://miriam-mr90.github.io/huckleberry/)

#### How it works

1. **Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions**

   - The repository includes a workflow file `deploy.yml` that handles deploying the project to GitHub Pages.
   - This workflow is triggered **every time changes are pushed to the `main` branch**.

2. **Build process**

   - The workflow installs dependencies and runs the build script (`npm run build`) to generate the production-ready files in the `dist/` folder.
   - Vite is configured with `base: './'`, so all assets (CSS, JS, images) are served correctly in GitHub Pages.

3. **Deployment to `gh-pages` branch**

   - After the build, the workflow uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` to push the contents of the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
   - The `clean: true` option ensures that old files are removed, so the branch always reflects the latest build.

4. **Result**

   - The `gh-pages` branch contains the production-ready version of the app.
   - GitHub Pages serves this branch at the URL above.
   - All future updates to `main` automatically trigger the workflow, rebuilding and redeploying the site.

#### Deployment Process

```text
main branch (source code)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îÇ Push changes
        ‚ñº
  GitHub Actions Workflow (`deploy.yml`)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îÇ Runs:
        ‚îÇ - npm install
        ‚îÇ - npm run build
        ‚îÇ - Deploy dist/ to gh-pages

### Vercel Deployment

**Live URL:** [https://huckleberry-<your-project-id>-miriams-projects-9a782c32.vercel.app/](huckleberry-git-master-miriams-projects-9a782c32.vercel.app/)

#### How it works

1. **Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions**

   - The repository includes a workflow file `deploy-vercel.yml` that handles deploying the project to Vercel.
   - This workflow is triggered **every time changes are pushed to the `prod` branch**.

2. **Build process**

   - The workflow installs dependencies and runs the build script (`npm run build`) to generate the production-ready files in the `dist/` folder.
   - Vite is configured with `base: '/'`, ensuring all assets (CSS, JS, images) work correctly on Vercel's hosting.

3. **Deployment to Vercel**

   - After the build, the workflow uses `amondnet/vercel-action` to deploy the `dist/` folder to the linked Vercel project.
   - The `--prod` argument ensures that the deployment goes to production, not a preview environment.
   - Vercel automatically handles routing, asset hashing, and caching for optimal performance.

4. **Result**

   - The live production version is served at the URL above.
   - Every push to the `prod` branch triggers the workflow, automatically building and deploying the latest version.
   - The site is publicly accessible without requiring a Vercel account, unless authentication is enabled.

#### Deployment Process

```text
prod branch (source code)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îÇ Push changes
        ‚ñº
  GitHub Actions Workflow (`deploy-vercel.yml`)

## üë©‚Äçüíª How can you edit this code?

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 2: Start the local API (json-server) for Botanix
npm run json-server

# Step 3: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Notes:**

- `npm run json-server` serves the Botanix data at http://localhost:4001/plants.
- `npm run dev` runs the frontend with Vite; it automatically proxies /api/plants to the json-server in development.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
